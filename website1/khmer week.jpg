<font size="4.5" color="#ffffff">Any student of body language knows that there is one universal truth: Whether we wish to or not, we communicate what we feel. We may keep our mouths shut, but our bodies inevitably find other ways to make our emotions known.


In the language of kinesics, this principle is called <font color="#02b4f5">leakage</font>: the involuntary betrayal of emotions through body language and gestures.

We play with a simple version of this principle as children. In the game<font color="#02b4f5"> "Hot or Cold,"</font> one player hides an object in a room, and the second player moves around the room, asking whether he is<font color="#02b4f5"> "hot" or "cold." </font>The behavior of the hider, who is sitting on the sidelines, is telling. Some hiders studiously look everywhere but at the hidden object, while others surreptitiously flick their eyes in that direction, as if to reassure themselves that it is still safely tucked away. With still other hiders, it's not so much the eyes as the body -- every movement is telling. If you're watching the hands, the eyes and the feet of the hider, you've got a veritable map. The object can be easy to find, because the person who hid it has been silently shouting its location the entire time.<br>
You will notice that stress forms the backbone of this course. This is no accident, as the role of stress has attracted much attention in the last few decades, and it is now recognised as a powerful factor in the cause of emotional disorders. We start by considering what is meant by the term ‘stress’, how it is perceived, and the evidence that it is a risk factor for the development of emotional disorders. We then move on to look at the biology of stress, in particular how it affects the brain.

The theme of effects on the brain is continued with a consideration of what has been learnt about the brain mechanisms underlying depression from the workings of antidepressants.

Finally, we consider the interaction between genes and the environment, and how this might influence the development of emotional disorders.</font>

<font size="4.5" color="#ffffff">A major aim of this course was to shed some light on the aetiology of depression and anxiety. At the end of it you should have some idea of the complexity of this enterprise. We have focused on one of the best-studied and hence best-understood contributors to psychopathology – stress. This has biological, social and psychological significance, and its operation can be studied and understood at all these levels.

The clear message you should take away is that interaction between these levels is enormously important in aetiology. Biological factors, such as dysregulation of the HPA axis and its consequences, possible abnormalities in brain neurotransmitter systems, the effects of stress on the developing brain at different ages, and the kinds of genes that an individual carries, appear to play an important part in the development and maintenance of emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety. However, these biological factors cannot be divorced from factors that are thought of as psychosocial, such as abuse in childhood, or stressful events and how we perceive them. This is very evident from the most recent developments in genetics, which show how, via epigenetic processes, experiences are translated into the activity (or expression) of genes, which then modify the workings of the brain in ways that affect mood.

Research into epigenetic influences on mental health and ill-health is burgeoning and is likely to make a very significant contribution to our understanding of aetiology in the years to come. If so, it should also help clarify how existing treatments, both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic, for emotional disorders work, or suggest new approaches that would work more effectively.</font></p>
