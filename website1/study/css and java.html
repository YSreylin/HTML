/*when you give height to css whatever the content your providing ,it is fit with the content

if we want to occupy background color to the whole
div element you have to provide height:100%

after that when you give the extra content inside the div you observed that the background color is not extend its color even we give height:100%

if we dont want to restrict the height means we have to remove the height properties and replace with min-height

min height is used to fit the background color with content ,even the content is extended*/
