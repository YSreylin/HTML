                    <h2>Life With The professor</h2>
                    <font size="5">Hachiko was an Akita Inu who was born in 1923 in Akita prefecture, Japan. 
                        A year later he became a gift for the daughter of a professor of agronomic engineering 
                        at Tokyo University. When the professor, Eisaburo Ueno, saw him for the first time, he 
                        realized that his legs were slightly crooked. They resembled the kanji that represents the 
                        \number 8 (八, which in Japanese is pronounced hachi), so he decided to name him Hachiko .
                        When Ueno's daughter grew up, she married and went to live with her husband, leaving the dog 
                        behind. The teacher had grown very fond of him, so he decided to keep Hachi instead of giving 
                        him away.
                        Ueno went to work by train every day and Hachiko became his faithful companion. Every morning 
                        he accompanied him to the Shibuya train station and in the afternoon he went back to meet him 
                        when he returned. True loyalty!</font>

                    <font size="5">One day, while teaching at the university, Ueno suffered a sudden cardiac arrest that 
                        ended his life. However, Hachiko continued to wait for him in Shibuya.
                        Day after day Hachiko went to the station and waited for hours for his owner, looking for his 
                        face among the thousands of strangers passing by. These days turned into months and months and 
                        eventually into years. Hachiko waited tirelessly for his owner for nine long years. Through rain,
                        snow or sunshine.                 
                        The inhabitants of Shibuya knew Hachiko and during this time they were in charge of feeding and 
                        taking care of him while he waited in the door of the station. This loyalty for his owner earned 
                        him the nickname "the faithful dog."            
                        People have shown much affection and admiration for Hachiko and his loyalty. So much so, a statue
                       of him was revealed in 1934 in front of the same train station where he waited for his owner every day.</font>

                    <h2 align="left">Death of Hachiko</h2>
                    <font size="5">On March 9, 1935, Hachiko was dead at the foot of the statue. He died because of old age, in the same place
                         where he had waited for his owner's return for nine years. The remains of the faithful dog were buried next to those 
                         of his owner in the cemetery of Aoyama in Tokyo.
                        During World War II all bronze statues were cast to manufacture armaments, including that of Hachiko. Nevertheless,
                         a few years later, a society was created to produce a new statue and to put it in the same place. Finally, Takeshi Ando, 
                         ​​the son of the original sculptor, was hired to rework the statue.            
                       Today the statue of Hachiko continues to stand in the same place, in front of the station of Shibuya. Every April 8 commemorates 
                        his fidelity.            
                        After all these years the story of Hachiko, the faithful dog is still alive because his love, loyalty and unconditional affection 
                        shook the heart of a population. And still continues to do so today. His legacy lives on.</font>
